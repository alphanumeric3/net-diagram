## Example CSV import. Use ## for comments and # for configuration. Paste CSV below.
## The following names are reserved and should not be used (or ignored):
## id, tooltip, placeholder(s), link and label (see below)
##
## use different text based on type
# labels: {"host":"%name%<br>%ip%", "router":"%name%<br>%ip%/?"}
# labelname: type
##
## use a certain style depending on type
## i don't know what causes this, maybe that router objects are parents of hosts,
## but the style never seems to apply! you'll have to make them swimlanes manually.
## in fact, try adding an extra router without children and you will see it becomes a swimlane.
## i just don't understand.
# styles: {"router":"whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;startSize=40;swimlane","host":""}
# stylename: type
##
## connect hosts and routers (i don't think i need this now)
## connect: {"from":"connect","to":"ip"}
##
## this identifies diagram cells by IP, so we can use the connect column in the CSV
## to link hosts to their routers
# identity: ip
# parent: connect
#
## Adds a prefix to the identity of cells to make sure they do not collide with existing cells (whose
## IDs are numbers from 0..n, sometimes with a GUID prefix in the context of realtime collaboration).
## Default is csvimport-.
#
# namespace: csvimport-
#
## Name or JSON of layout. Possible values are auto, none, verticaltree, horizontaltree,
## verticalflow, horizontalflow, organic, circle, orgchart or a JSON string as used in
## Layout, Apply. Default is auto.
#
# layout: auto
